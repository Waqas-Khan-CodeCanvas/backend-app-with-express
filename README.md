# 📚 Book Review Application – Node.js Project
## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Node.js–based Book Review Application developed as part of the hands-on lab assignment.
The application allows general users to browse and search books and registered users to log in and manage book reviews.

The project also demonstrates the use of Async/Await, Promises, and Axios in Node.js to fetch and process data asynchronously.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

Node.js

Express.js

Axios

JavaScript (ES6+)

REST APIs

Postman (for API testing)

## 👥 User Roles
🔹 General Users

Can view books

Can search books

Can read reviews

## 🔹 Registered Users

Can log in

Can add, modify, and delete their own reviews
